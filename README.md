### Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** 
This will be your most advanced project to date.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework & tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Pull from everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.**

Make sure you review your project proposal with your instructor so you can make sure it's **something that represents the breadth of your learning**, and make sure it's **something that looks nice**!

As always, Project Week will be a sprint, and doesn't end on the final day. 
Keep that in mind, and keep your MVP focused!

### Project Objectives

- Write code you want people to read, code that you're proud of and want to show off
- Build something nice and small (not a sprawling mess, but a real MVP)
- Build something with potential to grow (so that you can continue adding features to it after the course)
- Manage your time and emotions well (remember: this is a test-run for your life post-course)

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Be a full-stack application** include frontend and backend code
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** prioritized to help guide you
* **Be deployed online** so that it's publicly accessible

### Timeline

#### Friday, May 20th (9 AM) - Deliverables Due

- A Github repo with all instructors added as collaborators
- A readme.md in your repo
- A single paragraph description of what you want your project to be, and what technologies you plan to use
- A Trello board (that all of the instructors have been added to)
- User Stories written in the format "As a `<role>` I want `<feature>` so that `<reason>`"
- User stories organized into lists, for example:
 - Current (what you're currently working on)
 - Sprint (what you hope to have finished in this sprint, i.e. your MVP)
 - Backlog (your wishlist)
- ERD uploaded to your repo and linked to in your readme.md
- Wireframes uploaded to your repo and linked to in your readme.md

#### Thursday, May 26th (11 PM)
- Code Freeze

#### Friday, May 27th (9 AM) - Deliverables Due

You should have:

* A **working, full-stack application**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project with **feature branches**.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
    * An embedded screenshot of the app
    * Explanations of the **technologies** and **concepts** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for an instructor to clone down and run your app locally.
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome
    * A table of your **routes** with their **auth** requirements
* A **Trello board** that contains:
    * Your **user stories** organized in the appropriate list (ice box, sprint, current, completed).
    * Your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
    * Your **ERD** diagramming your models and their relationships

You should be prepared to give an 5 minute **Lightning** talk during which you:
- demo your application
- show a little bit of code
- tell the class what you are most proud of, and what feature you are going to implement next.

After you've finished your presentation, you will have a little time to answer questions from the class about your work.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Be consistent** with your code style.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** There is no excuse for non-perfect indentation. Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code** where it makes sense. Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function?
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
