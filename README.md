# Project-4

#### Friday, May 20th (9 AM) - Deliverables Due


I would like to create a website app which will show all the musician's statistics all in one place.The musician should essentially be able to do what a manager or agent should be able to do. Artist should be able to upload music in one place and it should be able to pull into various different sites.
