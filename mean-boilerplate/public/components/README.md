# Components

+ A components directory contains directives, services, filters, and related files.
+ Common data (images, models, utility files, etc.) might also live under components (e.g. components/lib/), or it can be stored externally.
+ Components can have subcomponent directories, including appended naming where possible.
+ Components may contain module definitions, if appropriate. (See "Module definitions" below.)
